# 🌹 Todo App System

This repository is the system-level coordinator for the Todo App ecosystem, defining requirements, CI/CD workflows, and compliance tracking for:

- iOS Client (Swift)
- Android Client (Kotlin) 
- IPFS Node (Go)

## 📚 System Overview

The Todo App is a distributed application that enables users to create, manage, and synchronize todo lists across multiple devices. It offers:

- Secure local storage on mobile devices
- IPFS-based data synchronization
- Cryptographic identity for secure data ownership
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android)

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The Todo App ecosystem is composed of multiple repositories:

- **[todo-system](https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-system)** - System-level coordination and requirements (this repo)
- **[todo-ios](https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-ios)** - iOS client (Swift)
- **[todo-android](https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-android)** - Android client (Kotlin)
- **[todo-ipfs](https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-ipfs)** - IPFS node implementation (Go)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone all repositories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-system.git
git clone https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-ios.git
git clone https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-android.git
git clone https://github.com/journalbrand/todo-ipfs.git
```

2. Open the workspace in VSCode:

```bash
code todo-system/todo-app.code-workspace
```

This will open all repositories in a single VSCode window with recommended extensions.

3. Install required tools:
   - Node.js and npm (for compliance dashboard)
   - jq (for JSON processing)
   - GitHub CLI (for workflow management)

## 📋 Requirements Management

This ecosystem uses structured JSON-LD for requirements management and traceability.

### Requirements Structure

- System-level requirements are defined in `todo-system/requirements/requirements.jsonld`
- Component-level requirements are defined in each component repository
- The JSON-LD schema is defined in `todo-system/requirements/context/requirements-context.jsonld`

### Requirements Hierarchy

Requirements follow a hierarchical structure:
- `System.X` - Top-level system requirements
- `System.X.Y` - Sub-requirements
- `System.X.Y.Component.Z` - Component-specific requirements

### Adding New Requirements

1. For system-level requirements, edit `todo-system/requirements/requirements.jsonld`
2. For component-level requirements, edit the appropriate component repository
3. Ensure that component requirements reference their parent system requirements
4. Add test mappings to link tests to requirements

## 🧪 Compliance Tracking

The Todo App uses a sophisticated compliance tracking system to ensure requirements are met.

### Compliance Matrix

The compliance matrix aggregates test results from all components and maps them to requirements.
- Generated by the `compliance-matrix.yml` workflow
- Stored in `compliance/reports/compliance_matrix.jsonld`
- Visualized in the compliance dashboard

### Compliance Dashboard

The compliance dashboard provides a visual representation of requirements coverage:
1. Run the dashboard locally:
```bash
cd todo-system
./serve-dashboard.sh
```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/compliance/dashboard/` in your browser

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The Todo App implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline across all repositories.

### CI/CD Structure

- **Component Level**: Each repository has its own CI workflow for building, testing, and validating requirements
- **System Level**: The system repository coordinates cross-repository workflows
- **Orchestrator**: A single workflow that triggers all component and system workflows

### Workflow Overview

1. **Orchestrator Workflow**: `todo-system/.github/workflows/orchestrator.yml`
   - Triggers all component workflows
   - Waits for completion
   - Triggers system-level workflows

2. **Component Workflows**:
   - iOS CI: `todo-ios/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Android CI: `todo-android/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - IPFS CI: `todo-ipfs/.github/workflows/ci.yml`

3. **System Workflows**:
   - Compliance Matrix: `todo-system/.github/workflows/compliance-matrix.yml`
   - Test Results Validation: `todo-system/.github/workflows/test-results-validation.yml`

### Running the CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline can be triggered in several ways:
1. **Manual Trigger**: Via GitHub Actions UI
2. **Automated Trigger**: On push to main branch
3. **Completion Trigger**: When dependent workflows complete

## 🧪 Current Project State
